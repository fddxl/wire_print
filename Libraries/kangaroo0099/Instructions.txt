Place all the .dll and .gha files in your Grasshopper libraries folder.

The location of this folder can be found from Grasshopper by clicking File>Special Folders>Components Folder

(it will typically be somewhere like C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries)

Make sure that all the dll and gha files are "unblocked" (In Windows explorer right-click the files and choose properties. If it is blocked this will appear under the "General" tab.

Remove all previous versions of the Kangaroo dll and gha files (even files in your downloads folder can cause conflicts)

Copy all the files from the UserObjects folder to your Grasshopper UserObjects folder (File>Special Folders>User Object Folder)

Restart Rhino

For further information and example files, please visit the Kangaroo group on the Grasshopper website: http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/kangaroo

Enjoy!
